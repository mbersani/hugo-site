Our objectives are:

 1. To revive bring up-to-date an [old database of formal methods courses](http://www4.di.uminho.pt/FME-SoE/resources.html) taught worldwide. We plan to
review this database yearly. The current FM course repository is [available
online](courses). You can contribute courses using the [form below](#fm-courses).

 2. To setup a repository of formal methods case studies, containing simpler as
well as more complex examples of using formal methods. This can be liken to the
Github repository for software or the Biomodels database for computational
models of biological processes. The simpler examples can be for instance used
in teaching, while the more complex for (self-)learning various formal methods
and for demonstrating the formal methods strength to, for instance, industry.

 3. To setup a secured repository of exam exercises for formal method courses.
These will be available only to teachers.

 4. To work towards achieving a BoK (Body of Knowledge) in Formal Methods, that
can enable self-learning as well as various future certifications in Formal
Methods. This objective will start up from [earlier efforts in this direction](http://formalmethods.wikia.com/wiki/FMBoK).

 5. To setup a list of "summer" schools in Formal Methods.


In the long run, we have the following goals:

 1. We plan to coordinate "providers" and "consumers" of Formal Methods, so that
when some researcher or industrial partner needs certain knowledge in Formal
Methods, we can advice where to address these needs.

 2. We plan to investigate whether certain degrees in Formal Methods are feasible.
We aim to see whether an International MSc program in Formal Methods can be
organised, for instance.

 3. We plan to make industry and life sciences beneficiaries of Formal Methods, by
providing case studies from Academia to Industry/Science to demonstrate
potential and by getting interesting/real life problems to analyse from
Industry/Science to Academia.
